# About Future Bitcoin Cash

### What is a *Future*?

A *Future* is an financial instrument representing some good or service to be delivered at some future date. 

Futures are a way to hedge risk by allowing a commodity producer to agree on a future price and date of delivery with a buyer.  

Financial futures allow parties to hedge risk or profit from stabilizing market volatility. 

### What is Future Bitcoin Cash (FBCH)?

Keeping with the philosophy of bitcoin, a trustless fully-backed currency should have a trustless fully-backed future. With CashTokens and a simple timelocked vault, a fully-backed trustless future token fairly simple easy. 

Futures are created by locking coins in a series vault corresponding to a future locktime. The corresponding token will then trade at a discount to the face value at maturity. 

### Why do people lock coins into futures?

Coupons are plain cash outputs that can be used to incentivize locking coins for futures. 

Coupons are not tokens, nor are they controlled by a central authority. Any one (or thing) that can send Bitcoin Cash to and address can create a coupon. Coupons are plain Bitcoin Cash unspent outputs, held by a contract.

### Where do the coupons come from?

Future coupons can come from anywhere.  Writing a coupon is permissionless. 

Future coupon writers send bitcoin to a contract corresponding to a future vault and locking denomination.

An individual may write many coupons at once, in the same transaction. A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) may emit a stream of coupons according to some predetermined logic. Coupon writers may have differing or conflicting goals. 

Coupons are cash, and verifiable on-chain.

### About Timeout

A timeout contract holds assets (cash or tokens) during a timeout period. If not withdrawn or 'refreshed' within the timeout window, all funds will be sent to the pre-defined receipt.

**⚠️ Note: Funds will be sent to the pre-defined receipt if not moved BEFORE timeout expires.**

### About Drip Mine

Drip mine is a contract demonstrating the potential of Miner Extractable Value (MEV). Each output of the contract can be spent by anyone, each transaction generates fees that benefit whoever mines the block. 

Bitcoin has always had built-in MEV, in the form of the block subsidy, which the first (coinbase) transaction that can contain newly minted coins. 

As the idea of bitcoin continues to develop, on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fork, the built-in block subsidy will become less and less important and revenue from including transactions will come to dominate miner revenue. 

Anyone-can-spend outputs held by the drip-mine covenant by clicking the colorful icons above. 

Anyone may contribute to the MEV fund by sending outputs here:

When the value of an unspent transaction output locked by the covenant falls below 740 satoshis, all the value is claimed in the next transaction and the output is 'burned'.

# About this app

[Vox.cash](https://vox.cash) is an integrated collection of financial tools using Bitcoin Cash.

This app is a reference implementation for an open on-chain protocol. Each app is driven by a [libauth authentication template](https://libauth.org/types/WalletTemplate.html) and corresponding javascript package.

# Business model

As a fully featured financial hub, Vox will be powered by user subscriptions fees.

Users will have a choice to subscribe in the following rates and currencies:

|   price   | token    |
| --------: | :---------- |
| 1,000,000 | WBCH (sats) |
|   900,000 | FBCH (sats, any series) |
|    50,000 | BPTS       |
|    50,000 | BADGERS    |

A subscription will entitle the user to flair and a ❤️ in the upper right-hand corner of their app for each active subscription. Subscriptions will be cancelable and transferable. 

All features will otherwise be available to all users without tiers. Subscriptions will not unlock any special features.
